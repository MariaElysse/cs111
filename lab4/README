NOTES: 
Included files: 
    * lab4-utils.c/.h: contains functions and structures used to do the grunt work of each feature of the program (reading from pins/stdio, processing commands, etc)
    * lab4_deploy.sh: copies everything from my laptop to the edison and builds
    * Makefile: builds components required. If it's on my laptop, it'll copy everything over to the edison then build the components. 
    * P4B_check.sh: Professor Kampe's test scripts
    * README: this file
    * lab4b.c: main c file that calls all the other functions.
