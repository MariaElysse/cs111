Reads temperatures from a thermistor attached to Analog pin 0 of an Intel Edison continuously, accepting commands without blocking.  
Commands (in stdin):  
    SCALE=F/C (switches output unit to Fahrenheit/Celsius)  
    PERIOD=SEC (sets the time between outputs to the integer number of seconds given)  
    STOP (stops data output)  
    START (starts data output)  
    OFF (terminates the program)  
Additionally, the program can be terminated with a button attached to pin D3.

Command-line switches: 
    --log=logfile (indicates a file that command and reading logs are to be appended to)  
    --scale=[F/C] (sets the output units before startup - Fahrenheit is the default)  
    --period=S (sets the time between outputs before startup)  

NOTES: 
Included files: 
    * lab4-utils.c/.h: contains functions and structures used to do the grunt work of each feature of the program (reading from pins/stdio, processing commands, etc)
    * lab4_deploy.sh: copies everything from my laptop to the edison and builds
    * Makefile: builds components required. If it's on my laptop, it'll copy everything over to the edison then build the components. 
    * P4B_check.sh: Professor Kampe's test scripts
    * README: this file
    * lab4b.c: main c file that calls all the other functions.
