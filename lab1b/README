Important notes:
* This server can easily support many more than one simultaneous unencrypted connections. (limit is probably the size_t max or your memory, whichever is first) You have to comment a small block of code lab1b-server.c to prevent the server from closing when there are no more connections open.

Limitations:
* The encryption probably doesn't work. I worked on it until midnight and if it doesn't work I don't think this is necessarily worth a slip day. And besides, I have a midterm on Wednesday.

Research:
Most of my network code was heavily inspired by Beej's Guide to Network Programming
